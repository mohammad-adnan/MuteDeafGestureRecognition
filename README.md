One of the most popular handicaps is the deaf and dumb type, which prevent 
person from listening and talking. The number of deaf and dumb in the world 
continuously increasing and they are introverted closed society. Therefore, 
Deaf-Dumb people do not have normal opportunities for learning. Uneducated 
Deaf- Dumb people face serious problem in communication with normal people in 
their society. It is notable, however, that most available application focus
only on learning or recognition of sign language. In this paper, we introduce
an integrated android application to blend uneducated Deaf-Dumb people within
society, and help them to communicate with normal people. The introduced 
application proposes an easy translator form that can translate 
some word from sign language to Arabic language.
